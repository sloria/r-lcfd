# A simple R project skeleton

An adaptation of Josh Reich's [LCFD workflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1434424/1157536).

Includes a `main.r` file which just runs the other files in sequence. You can also run `tests.r`, which runs the whole project along with your tests.

NOTE: The `testthat` package is required to run the tests.
